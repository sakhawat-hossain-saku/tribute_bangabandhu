          <h2>Father of the Nation</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</b> 17 March 1920 â€“ 15 August
            1975 was a Bangladeshi politician, revolutionary, statesman,
            activist and diarist. As a politician, Mujib had held continuous
            positions as president or prime minister from April 1971 until his
            assassination in August 1975: as president from 1971 to 1972 and
            briefly from 1975 until his death, and as prime minister from 1972
            to 1975. Mujib successfully led the Bangladeshi independence
            movement and restored the Bengali sovereignty after over two
            centuries following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, for which he is
            honoured as the 'Father of the Nation' in Bangladesh. In 2011, the
            fifteenth constitutional amendment in Bangladesh referred to Sheikh
            Mujib as the Father of the Nation who declared independence; these
            references were enshrined in the fifth, sixth, and seventh schedules
            of the constitution. His Bengali nationalist ideology,
            socio-political theories, and political doctrines are sometimes
            called Mujibism.
